# Educational Technology Plan

This Educational Technology Plan will outline course goals for an Introduction to Computer Science course.  It will discuss how to handle possible issues surrounding hardware and networking as well as reflect on learning effectiveness and impacts such as social and ethical impacts as well as resilience and flexibility for teaching modalities.

## Context

### Course

The course, Intro to Computer Science, will introduce you to the field of computer science and the fundamentals of computer programming. This course is specifically designed for students with no prior programming experience, and touches upon a variety of fundamental topics required to write computer programs. If you are interested in learning how to write interactive, graphical programs from an introductory level in a real programming language, this is the course for you. You will begin by learning the basics of editing and running programs. Then you will learn how to create 2D graphics using shapes and coordinates. Finally, you will learn how to create interactive graphics that you can control with the mouse. 
### Situation

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.

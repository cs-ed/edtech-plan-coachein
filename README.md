# Educational Technology Plan

This Educational Technology Plan will outline course goals for an Introduction to Computer Science course.  It will discuss how to handle possible issues surrounding hardware and networking as well as reflect on learning effectiveness and impacts such as social and ethical impacts as well as resilience and flexibility for teaching modalities.

## Context

### Course

The course, Intro to Computer Science, will introduce you to the field of computer science and the fundamentals of computing. This course is specifically designed for students with no prior experience, and will teach students about the basics of computing.  Students will be exposed to hardware components and their tasks.  The course will cover the Google Suite of software and will introduce students to basic coding and creating mini games.

### Situation

South Fork High School is a rural school in Miranda, California.  It is home to approximately 260 students in grades 9 through 12.  It is on a shared but divided campus with Miranda Junior High, which houses about 100 7th and 8th graders.  This is the only High School, aside from a necessary, small high school of 6 students, in the district that covers 750 plus square miles of rugged mountain terrain.  Many of our students live outside of town and can ride the bus for up to 1 and 1/2 hours to get to school.

The recent federal funding from COVID allowed our school to become a 1 to 1 school with Chromebooks for each student.  One is checked out when a student enrolls and it is that student's to use for the duration of their time at South Fork.  However, our students have an aversion to using these Chromebooks and will ask if they can complete the assignment on their phone instead.

The district has recently had an issue with student cell phone use in class.  The staff has been battling use, as most of the world, during instruction.  We have students that play games, watch TV or movies, are on social media, and are taking photos or filming during instruction.  The apathy for learning in our district is high.  In order to combat this, the password on the wifi has been changed several times this year.  Staff does not have access to this password, as the IT department believes they are giving the students this password and allowing them access to the network the school devices for the staff are on.  Therefore, every time the password is changed, the two IT people for our district must go to each classroom and reconnect each device, two at least per room, to the netowrk so that the staff can teach.

Due to our students living rurally, many of them do not have reliable internet or cell service at home.  They rely on the school wifi for their "screen time," however, the students are "hijacking" the network so that teacher devices are no longer able to connect to the network due to no more IP addresses available.

This happened three times this school year, and each time the students have access to the network within days.  The last time, the IT department decided to give each device on campus a one time connection password.  This worked, but also caused many problems with devices no longer working properly.  There were several creative solutions by the staff in order to get things connected and be able to teach with our technology again.

## Plan

One of the main goals of this class will be to teach device ettiquite and help students learn to use the Chromebook's tools successfully.  Hopefully, helping them be more tech savvy and ready for the workforce.  If the students can learn how to use their devices respecfully, and are shown how the Chromebooks can be a functional tool to help them be successful, some of the issues with dievice use in clas may subside.

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.

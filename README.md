# Educational Technology Plan

This Educational Technology Plan will outline course goals for an Introduction to Computer Science course.  It will discuss how to handle possible issues surrounding hardware and networking as well as reflect on learning effectiveness and impacts such as social and ethical impacts as well as resilience and flexibility for teaching modalities.

## Context

### Course

The course, Intro to Computer Science, will introduce you to the field of computer science and the fundamentals of computing. This course is specifically designed for students with no prior experience, and will teach students about the basics of computing.  Students will be exposed to hardware components and their tasks.  The course will cover the Google Suite of software and will introduce students to basic coding and creating mini games.

### Situation

South Fork High School is a rural school in Miranda, California.  It is home to approximately 260 students in grades 9 through 12.  It is on a shared but divided campus with Miranda Junior High, which houses about 100 7th and 8th graders.  This is the only High School, aside from a necessary, small high school of 6 students, in the district that covers 750 plus square miles of rugged mountain terrain.  Many of our students live outside of town and can ride the bus for up to 1 and 1/2 hours to get to school.

The recent federal funding from COVID allowed our school to become a 1 to 1 school with Chromebooks for each student.  One is checked out when a student enrolls and it is that student's to use for the duration of their time at South Fork.  However, our students have an aversion to using these Chromebooks and will ask if they can complete the assignment on their phone instead.

The district has recently had an issue with student cell phone use in class.  The staff has been battling use, as most of the world, during instruction.  We have students that play games, watch TV or movies, are on social media, and are taking photos or filming during instruction.  The apathy for learning in our district is high.  In order to combat this, the password on the wifi has been changed several times this year.  Staff does not have access to this password, as the IT department believes they are giving the students this password and allowing them access to the network the school devices for the staff are on.  Therefore, every time the password is changed, the two IT people for our district must go to each classroom and reconnect each device, two at least per room, to the network so that the staff can teach.

Due to our students living rurally, many of them do not have reliable internet or cell service at home.  They rely on the school wifi for their "screen time," however, the students are "hijacking" the network so that teacher devices are no longer able to connect to the network due to no more IP addresses available.

This happened three times this school year, and each time the students have access to the network within days.  The last time, the IT department decided to give each device on campus a one time connection password.  This worked, but also caused many problems with devices no longer working properly.  There were several creative solutions by the staff in order to get things connected and be able to teach with our technology again.

## Plan

One of the main goals of this class will be to teach device etiquette and help students learn to use the Chromebook's tools successfully.  Hopefully, helping them be more tech savvy and ready for the workforce.  If the students can learn how to use their devices respectfully, and are shown how the Chromebooks can be a functional tool to help them be successful, some of the issues with device use in class may subside.

The class will start with a little history about computers.  Then move into learning about computer parts and their jobs.  The course will discuss binary and 8-bit language and do some calculations in binary.  Next, the Google Suite will be explored.  Students will learn basic functions of Docs, Slides, Forms and Sheets.  They will also spend time learning to make minigames with Scratch.

### Software Specifications

All software used will be web based.  The course will use Chrome as the browser and the Google Suite for assignments.  Content and tasks will be presented on Google Classroom using Slides, Docs, and Forms, as well as links to video and website content.

### Hardware Specifications
Students will use one of two types of Chromebook.  Type one is Samsung model number XE310XBA. The operating system is Chrome OS and it has an Intel Celeron N4020 CPU, and an Intel UHD 600 or HD 500 Graphics card.  The display is 11.6 inches diagonal The hard drive is up to 64GB SSD and the RAM is up to 6 GB.  The input is 15V, 3A(45W).  

Type two is HP Chromebook 11A G8 EE.  The operating system is Chrome OS and it has an AMD A4 9120C processor.  The display is 11.6" diagonal and some are touchscreen.  The chromebook has 4 GB DDR4 memory and a 32 GB eMMC hard drive.  The wireless technology is Realtek 802.11a/b/g/n/ac (2x2) and is bluetooth enabled.  The input is 15V, 3A. 


### Application

We will use the technology above for in class assignments and assessments.  I will not be giving homework as many of the students at our school do not have access to the internet at home.  Daily points will be given for being on time and prepared, using technology for the given assignment, completing the assignment during the given time frame, participating positively in class, and being on topic when discussing things as a whole class or in small groups.

Assignments will cover a diverse array of introductory topics.  They will include learning about hardware components and how to decide what computer is right for the needs of the user.  We will learn basic functions of the Google Suite of tools and email etiquette.

We will learn about binary code, compliments, and addition/subtraction of 8-bit numbers.  We will also discuss the hierarchy of bits and bytes.  

We will discuss flow charts and how they are used in coding.  We will create flow charts for simple, everyday tasks as well as simple programs.  We will code with Scratch, making some simple games and animations.
We will introduce logic and discuss if, then statements and how they apply to coding.  

Our students know how to use their phones very well, but when it comes to other computers, they donâ€™ t know how to use them effectively as a tool.  Part of my class would focus on these basic uses and the efficiency and effectiveness of using them as the tools that they are.  The level of proficiency of the students in the class would drive how long the class focused on the basic ways a computer can help make our lives easier and more organized.

### Impacts

Having an Intro class at South Fork would help our students come out of high school better prepared for the technology based world we live in.  It would provide opportunities for these students that they might not have otherwise.  Our community economy is based largely on agriculture, fishing and logging, which are all on the decline if not practically gone.  This community needs to have a new skill set in order to sustain.  Computers and coding provide endless opportunities such as preparation for the military or for work coding in the private sector.  It will be a new avenue for our students to explore.  As the program grows, there is room for differentiated classes.  The Intro class is for every student.  Those who wish to continue could take higher level user classes for business or coding.

Our students had a hard time transitioning to virtual education, many withdrew from classes and assignments.  The social emotional impacts are prevalent in our students.  They have an apathy towards tradition learning as well as technology based learning.  Having a Computer Science pathway at our school could turn some of that apathy around.  Teaching students what computers can do to make our lives easier, more organized and even fun could help the students have a better attitude towards technology other than the cell phone.
